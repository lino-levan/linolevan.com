# Lino's Personal Site

My website, but rewritten in Fresh this time! So thankful to move away from the
slow nonsense that was Next.js.

### Usage

First, set up a discord webhook and put the url in `.env` as `WEBHOOK_URL`.

Now, since the site is written in [Deno](https://deno.land), so it's as simple
as

```
deno task start
```
