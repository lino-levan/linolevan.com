It's officially a yearly tradition for me to write a "year in review" post!

Very exciting. Let's go over some of the things that happened in my life in this
past year.

## How were my predictions for 2023?

In the [last blog post](/blog/2022_wrapped), I made a few predictions for 2023.
Let's see how they turned out. I think... it was very mixed.

> Javascript usage will go down and Typescript will continue to be popularized

Javascript usage has not gone down. In fact, it's only gone up. I think this is
because it's kind of just the default language for the web. In hindsight, I
think this prediction was a bit silly. I think it's more likely that Javascript
will continue to be the default language for the web, and Typescript will
continue to be popularized at the same time. They don't have to be mutually
exclusive.

> Deno will continue to grow in adoption and become the industry standard

I was half right here. Deno has continued to grow in adoption, but it's still
not the industry standard. Nowadays, I realize that with all of the new
javascript runtimes coming into existence, the fragmentation in the ecosystem
will continue to grow. There's just too many people involved and too much legacy
code.

> Serverless will continue to grow and dominate the web development space

I was probably the most right here out of all of my predictions. Serverless has
continued to grow and dominate the web development space. I think this is
because of the rise of cloud computing and the need for fast, easy-to-scale
applications.

With new stuff on the horizon like Bun's serverless offering, I think this trend
will continue.

> NoSQL Database alternatives will continue to pop up and be popularized

NoSQL databases are still popular, but I don't think they're as talked about as
they were in 2021. I think this is because of the rise of a new type of
"NewSQL"-y databases (like PlanetScale or TheNile). These databases are designed
to be more scalable than traditional SQL databases, which is why they're gaining
adoption now.

We're also seeing the rise again of key-value stores like Redis, Memcached, and
(my personal favorite) Deno KV. I think this is because of the rise of
serverless and the need for fast, easy-to-scale data stores.

> Rust will continue to gain marketshare over other low-level languages

Rust has continued to gain marketshare over other low-level languages. I'm even
using it for research at my university!

## What happened in my life in 2023?

Okay, enough yapping about predictions. Let's talk about what actually happened
in my life in 2023.

Let's go over some of the highlights.

- I entered my second (and last) year of undergrad
- I became the number one contributor to the
  [Deno by example repository](https://github.com/denoland/denobyexample)
- I became the number one non-core contributor to the
  [Deno standard library](https://github.com/denoland/deno_std) for a while
  (heck you [@timreichen](https://github.com/timreichen))
- I wrote my first programming language (called
  [Lispy](htrp://github.com/lino-levan/lispy))
- I made [Astral](https://github.com/lino-levan/astral), a browser automation
  library like Puppeteer but written specifically for Deno
- I got to chat with [Eric Vishria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Vishria)
  of Benchmark Capital
- I compiled Chromium for the first time!

There's probably more, but I can't remember them right now. It's really not that
deep. I'm just a college student who likes to code.

## What about my goals for 2023?

> I would like to have 1000 Github commits (~2x my current amount)

Completely smashed this goal. I'm at 1,485 commits as I'm writing this :)

> I would like to have 365 new poems (~10x my current amount)

After like two weeks, I gave up on this goal. Unfortunate, hope to try again in
the future.

> I would like to have released my card game

I did not release my card game. I'm still working on it, but it's not ready yet.
I'm hoping to release it in 2023.

> I would like to have released a short story physically

Nope.

> I would like to have officially joined a part of an organization I am a big
> fan of

Not yet, fingers crossed for 2024.

## What are my predictions for 2024?

Okay, now that we've gone over what happened in 2023, let's talk about what I
think will happen in 2024.

> Javascript usage will continue to go up and Typescript will continue to be
> popularized

I think this is a pretty safe bet. Javascript is the default language for the
web, and Typescript is the most popular language for the web. I don't see this
changing anytime soon.

> I will move to Stoat as my primary programming language

I've been seeing [Stoat](https://github.com/Im-Beast/stoat/tree/main) being
worked on more and more, and I'm really excited about it. I think it's a really
cool language, and I'm excited to see where it goes. Please check it out if you
haven't already! (and Beast if you're reading this please keep working on it!)

> I will release two of the projects I have in the works right now

No spoilers. You'll have to wait and see.

> I will finally learn time management

I'm really bad at time management. It's... yeah. I'm hoping to get better at it
in 2024.

## Goals for 2024

Here's to the annual goals for 2024!

- I would like to have 2000 Github commits (~1.5x my current amount)
- I would like to have 365 new poems (1 poem a day)
- I would like to have released my card game
- I would like to start working at a startup

Bonus goal: I'm trying to be healthier this year. The real struggle.

## Conclusion

I need to stop writing these posts late, on the day of the new year. I'm tired.
More importantly, I probably need to make a standard format and write this post
over the course of the year. I think that would be a lot more fun.

Anyways, thanks for reading! I hope you have a great 2024.
