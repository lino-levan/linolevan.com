Hey, Jerry.

I just wanted to write this letter to you thanking you for all the work you did
last year, being a great mentor, a great friend, and most importantly a great
person. Monday nights were always the highlight of my week. Every meeting I was
excited to be there, just to say hi. You were friendly to everyone and you were
always smiling through the good times and the bad. I cherished those moments.

You were probably one of the most talented guys I have ever met. You were a
great club president, a great speaker, a great pitcher, a great marketer, a
great conversationalist. You could do anything. You had the world in your hands.
You had a startup, you had a team, you had a dream.

I was super excited to meet up this summer. That was such a great brunch. I got
to see you again, after graduation, and some of the other buddies in the club.
The food was great, the waiting was a bit too long, but I enjoyed every second
of it. I remember how excited you were to be wearing that cheap suit you got.
You were just trying a new strategy to succeed in the entrepreneurship world. I
lived to see your progress.

I just heard about what happened today. I wish I didn't have to learn about it
this way. I wish I had reached out earlier, just to say goodbye. My thoughts and
prayers go out to your family.

Bye Jerry. Rest well. You deserve it buddy.
